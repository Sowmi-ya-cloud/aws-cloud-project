`Python code: 

from google.colab import files                           # Upload dataset 
uploaded = files.upload()

import pandas as pd                                      # Import libraries 
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv("covid_19_clean_complete.csv")          # Load dataset 

df.head()                                                # Inspect data
df.info()
df.shape`
df.describe()

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
